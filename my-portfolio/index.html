        <p>Hello, my name is Joshua Swanson and I am a 19 year old undergraduate majoring in Computer Science at Rutgers University. I am interested in technology and enjoy
		working with others to create engaging and interesting projects. I enjoy learning about various emerging new technologies and have spent a good amount of time over
		the years working on various programming projects. In my free time, I enjoy going on walks and hikes, playing video games, and learning something new.</p>
		
		<h2>Website Information</h2>
		<p>The various pages on my site contain information regarding my experience in relation to technology and some of the projects and skills I have developed over
		the years. Furthermore, the site contains a page which speaks on some of my future ambitions/career goals, in addition to a page with important contact information.
